I am a PhD student in Cornell's physics department interested broadly in fluid dynamics, and more specifically in geophysical flows. Currently, I am working on modeling the deformation of the earth's surface in response to the massive glaciations of the last Ice Age.

Though I spend most of my time studying fluids through my computers, I really enjoy working with fluids on the practical side, as well.  My fluids laboratory is adjacent to my living room and is equipped with heating and cooling units, turbulence generators, large and small mixing mixing apparatuses, and a well-stocked chemical cabinet. Of particular interest to me is the formation of muliphase slurries and the solidification of colloidal protein suspensions - ICE CREAM!
