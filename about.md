I am in the final year of a Ph.D. in Geophysics at Cornell University. My interests include computational fluid dynamics and statistical physics in general. My thesis research focuses on computing how the earth responds to the mass redistributions of the last ice age, when over 4 million Gigatons of water (about 3% of the oceans) moved from the ocean to the continents, and predicting the effects this is having on sea level changes today using sparse surface observations.

Though I spend most of my time studying fluids on the computer, I also enjoy working with fluids on the practical side.  My fluids laboratory is adjacent to my living room and is equipped with heating and cooling units, turbulence generators, large and small mixing mixing apparatuses, and a well-stocked chemical cabinet. Of particular interest to me is the formation of muliphase slurries and the solidification of colloidal protein suspensions - ICE CREAM!
