I'll be discussing 'GC068-0004: Data and Simulacra, toward a framework for inclusive coproduction' on Friday, 11 Dec 

And check out my talk for session C067: Modeling of the Cryosphere: Glaciers and Ice Sheets, which I'll be available to answer questions on on 16 Dec from 20:30-21:30 PST (not my first choice of time)
