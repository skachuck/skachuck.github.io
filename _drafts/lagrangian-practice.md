I was asked to use the time to practice writing down Lagrangians for systems, so we proposed the following problems.
1. The toy in pediatricians' offices across the country, where a small wooden block slides (we'll assume frictionlessly, though they often have disappointingly large friction) along a bent wire.
2. A spring suspended from the roof of a train car going at a constant velocity $v$
    a. At first the problem seems upsettingly easy, but...
    b. what happens when the mass is accidentally displaced a small bit from the vertical?
