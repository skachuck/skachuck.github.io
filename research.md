<h2>Continuum Damage Mechanics</h2>
Half of the water coming from the Antarctica comes off the ice by breaking off into icebergs, which float away and melt later, but the processes describing ice fracture and continental ice flow span almost ten orders of magnitude in length- and time-scales. To make predictions of large time and space scales, though, maybe we don't need to get all the atomic details right - similar to how you don't need to know the position and spin of every atom in a bar magnet to say something about how it interacts with a piece of iron. This project uses continuum mechanics to devlop and explore effective models of calving, continuum damage mechanics, to predict what the ice sheets will do in a changing climate.

<h2>Stochastic Calving Models</h2>
Iceberg calving events come in all shapes and sizes, and occur somewhat unpredictably, but appear to follow a common distribution that also explains, among other things, the earthquake Gutenberg-Richter distribution. Statistical physics suggests this may be due to a tendency for a system to evolve . Can we use this connection to postulate a better long-term, average calving law?
